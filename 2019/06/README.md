# Python

It feels like cheating but this is only a handful of lines in Python, thanks
to the [`networkx`](https://networkx.github.io/) module:

```python
import networkx


graph = networkx.DiGraph()

with open("input.txt") as i:
    for orbit in i.readlines():
        graph.add_edge(*(obj.strip() for obj in orbit.split(")")))

print(networkx.transitive_closure(graph).size())
print(networkx.shortest_path_length(graph.to_undirected(), "YOU", "SAN") - 2)
```

But we're not doing Python this yearâ€¦
