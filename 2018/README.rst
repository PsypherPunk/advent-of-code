===================
Advent of Code 2018
===================

My attempt at 2018's `Advent of Code <https://adventofcode.com/2018>`_.

For some reason I decided to attempt this in a 25-languages-in-25-days
fashion. For the record, *yes*, I am regretting this quite a bit.

* Day 1: Chronal Calibration [SML]
* Day 2: Inventory Management System [C]
* Day 3: No Matter How You Slice It [Java]
* Day 4: Repose Record [C++]
