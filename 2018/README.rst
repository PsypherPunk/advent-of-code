===================
Advent of Code 2018
===================

My attempt at 2018's `Advent of Code <https://adventofcode.com/2018>`_.

For some reason I decided to attempt this in a 25-languages-in-25-days fashion.
For the record, *yes*, I am regretting this quite a bit.

* Day 1: Chronal Calibration [SML]
* Day 2: Inventory Management System [C]
* Day 3: No Matter How You Slice It [Java]
* Day 4: Repose Record [C++]
* Day 5: Alchemical Reduction [JavaScript]
* Day 6: Chronal Coordinates [C#]
* Day 7: The Sum of Its Parts [Rust]
* Day 8: Memory Maneuver [Perl]
* Day 9: Marble Mania [TypeScript/deno]
* Day 10: The Stars Align [Ruby]
* Day 11: Chronal Charge [Python/Numpy]
* Day 12: Subterranean Sustainability [bash]
* Day 13: Mine Cart Madness [Lua]
* Day 14: Chocolate Charts [Tcl]

Addendum
========

Having run out of steam around week two every year since, I think it's
safe to say this was overly ambitious for my first year.

Every day post-*Day 14* was implemented—and *Day 7* was re-implemented—in Rust.
